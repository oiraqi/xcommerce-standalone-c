# Milestone 3: Top-down Approach / C Functions / Multi-file Programming / Partial Code Compiling
## Problem Statement
Now, we would like to handle *n* customers (calls), one after the other. And just like 1.5, each customer may order one or more products from the three-product catalog, again and again, until s/he's done. Then the operator, moves to the next customer. Before receiving any call, the operator must first initialize the stock by setting the price and quantity of each product.
- Design the high-level algorithm
- Design lower-level algorithms
- Identify the different files that compose your C program
- Give the content of your header file
- Implement the main function
- Partially compile its corresponding file as an object file
- Implement all needed functions
- Partially compile their corresponding file(s) as an object file
- Compile and link all oject files to generate your executable program
- Run and test your executable program
